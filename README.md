This is the repository for a LLM-powered AI solution for performing in-depth financial research and analysis. This system is based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), utilizing a locally run `Llama2-7b-chat` LLM, developed by Meta and the `UAE-Large-V1` text embedding model developed by WhereIsAI. This system uses completely open-source components and takes care of the data security considerations as well, by hosting everything on a local system.
